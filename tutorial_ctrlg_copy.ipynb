For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 76%.Is ringing alarm more likely than silent alarm overall?Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph that depicts the relationships in the scenario. Use X to represent husband. Use V2 to represent wife. Use Y to represent alarm clock. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -> var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explaining away effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatment effect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Formalize the query: Translate the query into its formal mathematical expression based on its type, utilizing the 'do(·)' notation or counterfactual notations as needed. Step 4) Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form 'P(...)=...' or 'P(...|...)=...', each probability being separated by a semicolon. Stick to the previously mentioned denotations for the variables. Step 5) Given all the information above, deduce the estimand using skills such as do-calculus, counterfactual prediction, and the basics of probabilities. Answer step by step. Step 6) Insert the relevant data in Step 4 into the estimand, perform basic arithmetic calculations, and derive the final answer. There is an identifiable answer.

Question: For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 8%. For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 54%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 41%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 86%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 74%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 24%. Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph thatdepicts the relationships in the scenario. Use X to represent husband. Use V2 to represent wife. Use Y to represent alarm clock. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -&gt; var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explainingaway effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatmenteffect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form 'P(...)=...' or 'P(...|...)=...', each probability being separated by a semicolon. Stick to the previously mentioned denotations for the variables. Based on all the reasoning above, output &lt;YES&gt; or &lt;NO&gt; to answer the following question: If we disregard the mediation effect through wife, would husband positively affect alarm clock?</td>\n",

       "0     Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships. Question: For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 8%. For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 54%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 41%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 86%. For husbands that don't set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 74%. For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 24%. Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph thatdepicts the relationships in the scenario. Use X to represent husband. Use V2 to represent wife. Use Y to represent alarm clock. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -> var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explainingaway effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatmenteffect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form 'P(...)=...' or 'P(...|...)=...', each probability being separated by a semicolon. Stick to the previously mentioned denotations for the variables. Based on all the reasoning above, output <YES> or <NO> to answer the following question: If we disregard the mediation effect through wife, would husband positively affect alarm clock?   \n",

Question: We know that zuph or jyka causes glimx. We observed an individual is jyka. Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph thatdepicts the relationships in the scenario. Use V2 to represent jyka. Use X to represent zuph. Use Y to represent glimx. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -> var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explainingaway effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatmenteffect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form 'P(...)=...' or 'P(...|...)=...', each probability being separated by a semicolon. Stick to the previously mentioned denotations for the variables. Based on all the reasoning above, output <YES> or <NO> to answer the following question: Would an individual is glimx if not zuph instead of zuph?   \n",
